          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            Hello, Thanks again for taking a look at my Portfolio. Hopefully through each page I can keep you engaged enough that you would like to meet me in person. I will give you a little about me. I am currently 24 and a self taught Full-Stack Developer living in the Greater Boston area. Over the last couple of years, I have been working to pursue my education and work to learn my craft as a Full Stack Developer.
          </p>
          <h3>What Do I know?</h3>

          <p>
            Seeing as though I am still fairly knew to the industry and there is so much more to to learn, I can't claim to know a lot Over the last few months I have been working extensively to learn the basics of the Full stack trade.... Some of the tese technologies include.
          </p>

          <h3>What do I hope to do?</h3>
          <p>
            I want to be apart of an orgranization that cares. I put an emphasis on family and friends and I want my workplace to be the same. I want to help people. Through my family, I was always taught that I should give back and do whatever I can for people. I am a firm believer in education and teaching from experience. I am excited about where life has to take me and uncertainty of the next step. Life is full of suprises so why not make the best of them all?
          </p>
          <h3>
            Where do I hope to go?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Out of this world and beyond!!!!! When I was younger I've always wanted to escape from this planet and find other life forms. Instead I hope to establish a name for myself by helping those in need. Whatever project enables me to take care of people and help those who can not help themselves is a worthy cause to me.
          </p>
