  <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio</h1>
  <p>
    On this website I hope to convey what the type of person and developer that I am. Here I am going to highlight all the aspects and things that make up the person that I am. Please look and enjoy all the content. Feel free to contact me if you have any
    questions or just want to chat.

    Hello!!!! I am an aspiring developer born and raised in Boston. From the age of 5 it was my dream to be an astronaut and fly into space, and through school I was curious and had a hunger to learn everything that I possibly could. With everything from
    learning about molecules in chemistry to studying the history of Greece, everything I learn I deem important.
    Many people know me but often find out that they never know the actual me. I have many layers and hopefully you will be able to better understand them all by looking through my portfolio.
